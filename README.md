- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AarushTewari, a student of BITS Pilani
- I work as a back-end developer at Student Union Technical Team, BITS Pilani (@bitssutechteam) - a student club that makes app to ease the campus life of students by catering to their academic and non academic needs.
- Most of my work up untill now have been done using Python and Django.
- Almost all my repositories where I have made significant contribution are private, I have only some basic stuff public on my profile as of now.
